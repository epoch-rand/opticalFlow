#### Dense Motion Estimation
Abstract: *An implementation of the Farneback approach for dense motion estimation. Computing the optical flow vector for every pixel of each frame, we are able to infer the direction and velocity of both object and camera.*

### Packages

'os' `numpy` `opencv` `scipy`

### Requirements

- Both Linux and Windows are supported. Linux is recommended for performance and compatibility reasons.
- 64-bit Python 3.7.9 installation. We recommend Anaconda3 with numpy 1.19.1 or newer.
